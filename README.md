Cubic Bézier Curves
===================

If you have used the pen tool in Illustrator or Photoshop, you (for sure) have the experience of playing with Bézier curves. Popularly used to draw vector graphics and fonts, it was first (arguably) introduced by Pierre Bézier for visual specification of car parts. Check [A Primer on Bézier Curves](http://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/) if you want to know the math.

You can draw Bézier curves on your browser using bezierCurveTo() function and with a simple trick, you can create a neat animation by strategically drawing several Bézier Curves. You can see [the demo](http://codecyb.org/bezier/) here. You could create your new wallpaper with it!
